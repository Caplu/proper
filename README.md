PROPER™ — Semantic Rich Text Editor
==================

PROPER is a Semantic Texteditor based on HTML's `contenteditable` attribute. It's being developed in the context of [Substance](http://github.com/michael/substance), a data driven document authoring engine.

The goal is to output proper semantic HTML by restricting the set of possible tags. To accomplish this we use Sanitize.js in order to guarantee valid output as browsers tend to mess up the markup.
