PROPER™ — Semantic Texteditor
==================

PROPER is a Semantic Texteditor based on HTML's `contenteditable` attribute. It's being developed in the context of [Substance](http://github.com/michael/substance), a data driven document authoring engine.

The goal is to output proper semantic HTML by restricting the set of possible tags. We'll implement a sanitizer in order to guarantee valid output as browsers tend to mess up the markup. 


This is a work in progress ...
